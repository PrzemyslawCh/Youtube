        "In this **notebook**, we present a comprehensive pipeline for processing YouTube videos. The process begins by extracting the transcript from a given YouTube video. Once we have the **transcript**, we break it into **segments** or '**chunks**' based on the video's **chapters**. Lastly, we aim to summarize each chunk to give readers a quick understanding of the content within each chapter. However, please note that the **summarization** functionality is currently under development and is not yet available.\n",

        "In this cell, we provide functions for downloading transcripts of YouTube videos, breaking them into chunks based on provided chapters, and parsing chapter timestamps from video descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are brief descriptions of each function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `download_transcript_plaintext(video_url)`: This function downloads the plaintext transcript of a given YouTube video. It takes the URL of the video as an input, extracts the video ID, requests the video page, parses the HTML to find the title, and uses the YouTubeTranscriptApi to get the transcript. It then writes the transcript to a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `download_transcript_withtimestamps(video_url)`: Similar to the first function, but it also includes timestamps with the transcript. The resulting transcript is downloaded as a text file.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `create_transcript_chunks(transcript, chapters, title)`: This function takes a transcript (in a specific format), a list of chapter timestamp details, and the title of the video. It then creates chunks of transcript based on the chapter details and saves these chunks in a new text file.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `get_video_description(url, api_key)`: This function retrieves the video description from the YouTube Data API. It requires the video ID and the API key as input parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. `parse_chapters(description)`: This function takes a YouTube video description, extracts chapter timestamps and their corresponding titles using a regular expression. It returns these as a list of dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. `extract_video_id_from_url(url)`: This function takes a YouTube URL as input and returns the unique video ID associated with the video. It uses Python's string manipulation methods to identify and extract the video ID. It returns None if the input URL does not contain \"v=\", indicating that it may not be a valid YouTube URL.\n"
